# Fake News Classifier

## Problem Statement
Create an algorithm to determine if a given article is fake news or not. 

## Data Set
Data set was obtained from Kaggle (URL: https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset). It includes articles which were determined as Fake or True.

## Executive Summary
- Data Extraction
- Cleaning
- Lemmatizing
- Train Test Split
- Count Vectorizer
- Modelling
- Model Evaluation

## Approach
I used Keras to classify the dataset into real and fake news, and obtained >90% accuracy. The model was evaluated using confusion matrix, with specificity of 0.9966 and sensitivity of 0.9974.
